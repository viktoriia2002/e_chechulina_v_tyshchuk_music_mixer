# How it works:
Our party mixer works very simply so that everyone can safely take advantage of the incredible opportunity to create their own special music track. In order to start creating your own unique track all you need to do is take one of the tracks and move it to one of the drop zones that is located at the bottom. And then move all the tracks in the same way and create a tune to your taste. Also, to stop a track you don't like, you just need to click on the square with one mouse button and the music will stop playing. Then you can move the track to the next cell to get access to the track that was used by you earlier. And voila, everything is ready!
